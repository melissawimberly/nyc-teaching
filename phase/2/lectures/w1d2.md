# Rest Crud / Data
Week 1 Day 2

# Morning
## Routes, CRUD, Rest, Oh my! 

### Routes
*  Where they go
*  What about Params? 
*  url params vs query params

### CRUD
*  Create
*  Read 
*  Update
*  Delete

### Rest
*  Representational State Transfer
*  Best Practices / Standards
*  Almost strictly used with HTTP 
*  Client <-> Server
*  Stateless
  *  Requests contain everything they need to be fullfilled

### Putting it all Together
*  www.squirre.ly                -> GET    "/"
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels      -> GET    "squirrels/index"  -> squirrels#index
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels/new  -> GET    "squirrels/new"    -> squirrles#new
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels/1    -> GET    "squirrels/:id"    -> squirrles#show
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels      -> POST   "squirrels"        -> squirrles#create
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels/1    -> PUT    "squirrels/:id"    -> squirrles#update
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels/1    -> DELETE "squirrels/:id"    -> squirrles#destroy


##### Looking Nested Routes 
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels/1/acrons      -> GET   "squirrels/:squirrel_id/acrons"        -> acrons#index
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels/1/acrons/new  -> GET   "squirrels/:squirrel_id/acrons/new"    -> acrons#new
*  www.squirre.ly/squirrels/1/acrons/3    -> GET   "squirrels/:squirrel_id/acrons/:id"    -> acrons#show
