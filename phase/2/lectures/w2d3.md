# Object Oriented JavaScript / Ajax Crud
Using the javascript constructor pattern we are going to implement basic CRUD operations. Implementing a full stack we will use sinatra as our back end, creating a full stack app. 

Using the Squirre.ly data model implement the Squirrel model in Javascript

  #### [open] app/models/squirrel.rb

  #### [open] app/views/layout.erb
  
  #### [open] public/js/squirrel.js

    #public/js/squirrel.js
    function Squirrel(name, treeMail, tailLength){

    }    


Add the properties name, tailLength, treeMail
Discuss sending back flat data

Add properties: nutCount, treeCount

  this.name = name; 
  this.tailLength = tailLength;
  this.treeMail = treeMail;

  this.nutCount = 0;
  this.treeCount = 0;


## Get
If we are on the list_squirrels.erb get all of the squirrels and hydrate Squirrels

## Put
Now we will make a proto method that we can execute to update the object. 
We will see tomorrow how this will tie into the our JS MVC.

## Post
Implement new on a click if needed

## Delete
Implement a delete if needed
